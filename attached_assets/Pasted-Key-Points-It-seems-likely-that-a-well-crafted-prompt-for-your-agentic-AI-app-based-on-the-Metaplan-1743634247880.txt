Key Points
It seems likely that a well-crafted prompt for your agentic AI app, based on the Metaplane meeting notes, can help extract key features for developing a data observability application.
The prompt should instruct the AI to generate user stories in a standard format, covering monitoring, integrations, and governance, among other aspects.
Research suggests including roles like data engineers and IT administrators in the user stories to ensure comprehensive coverage.
Prompt for Agentic AI App Development
Overview
To assist in developing your data observability application using the Metaplane discussion as a reference, here's a prompt designed for your agentic AI app. This prompt leverages the detailed meeting notes to extract essential features and functionalities, ensuring your application aligns with industry standards for data observability.

Prompt Details
The prompt instructs the AI to analyze the provided meeting notes and generate user stories in the format "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]." It covers key areas such as:

Data Monitoring and Alerting: Ensuring the AI captures how Metaplane detects issues like job failures and data freshness, crucial for maintaining data reliability.
Integrations: Highlighting connections with tools like Snowflake, DBT, and data catalogs, which are vital for a modern data stack.
Governance and Access Control: Including features like role-based access control and auditing, as mentioned in follow-up tasks, to ensure security and compliance.
This approach ensures the AI app provides actionable insights for your development process, focusing on user needs and technical integrations.

Unexpected Detail
An interesting aspect is the inclusion of follow-up tasks like Okta SSO support and private link connectivity, which might not be immediately obvious but are critical for enterprise-grade applications, enhancing security and user experience.

Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Prompt Development for Agentic AI App
This section provides a comprehensive analysis of crafting a prompt for your agentic AI app, drawing from the extensive meeting notes on Metaplane, a data observability platform. The goal is to ensure your application development leverages key insights from the discussion, covering features, integrations, and best practices for data observability in an enterprise setting.

Background and Context
The meeting notes detail a discussion involving team introductions, Metaplane's overview, and specific features like monitoring, alerting, and integrations with tools such as Snowflake, DBT, and Airflow. The notes also include follow-up tasks like role-based access control and Okta SSO support, indicating areas of interest for enterprise implementation. Given your focus on developing a similar application, the prompt aims to extract these details into actionable user stories, ensuring alignment with user needs and technical requirements.

Data observability, as defined in external sources, involves monitoring and maintaining data health across systems, identifying issues in near-real time, and ensuring reliability. This aligns with Metaplane's focus, as described in the notes, on detecting job failures, surfacing insights, and understanding data usage and costs. For instance, Metaplane's ability to index systems and build monitors for data quality, as demonstrated by Riley Kimball, is a core feature that your application could emulate.

Prompt Development Process
The process began by interpreting your request to write a prompt for your agentic AI app, referencing the Metaplane discussion. Given the app's agentic nature, capable of performing tasks and generating content, the prompt was designed to instruct the AI to analyze the notes and produce user stories. This format, "As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]," is standard in agile development, ensuring clarity on user needs and benefits.

Key considerations included:

Extracting Features: The notes highlight Metaplane's three main functions: ensuring teams are the first to know about data issues, providing faster resolution paths, and helping understand data usage and costs. These translate into user stories like "As a data engineer, I want real-time alerts for data freshness issues so that I can resolve them quickly."
Integrations: The demo by Riley Kimball showed Metaplane's end-to-end pipeline coverage, from S3 to BI tools like Power BI and Sigma. This led to stories like "As an architect, I want integration with Snowflake and DBT so that I can monitor data flow seamlessly."
Follow-Up Tasks: Tasks like confirming Okta SSO support and private link connectivity were included, resulting in stories like "As an IT administrator, I want Okta SSO integration so that users can authenticate securely."
The prompt also considered roles mentioned in the notes, such as Eric (Snowflake architect), Molly (data engineer on investments), and Sahlem (business engagement lead), ensuring stories cover data engineers, architects, business users, and IT administrators. This comprehensive approach ensures the application addresses diverse user needs.

Detailed User Story Examples
Based on the notes, potential user stories include:

"As a data engineer, I want automated monitoring for job failures so that I can prevent downstream impacts on data products."
"As a business user, I want insights into data freshness in BI tools so that I can trust the reports for decision-making."
"As an architect, I want lineage mapping with data catalogs like Atlan so that I can understand data flow and avoid metadata duplication."
These stories address key challenges like detecting issues early, ensuring data reliability, and optimizing costs, as emphasized in the notes.

Technical Integrations and Considerations
The notes detail Metaplane's integrations, such as syncing DBT tests, supporting on-prem databases via SSH, and providing API support for configuration. This led to stories like "As a data engineer, I want DBT test results synced with the platform so that I can monitor performance in one place." Additionally, governance features like query logging and role-based access control were included, ensuring security and compliance, as seen in follow-up tasks.

An unexpected detail was the emphasis on automation via webhooks, mentioned in the notes, which could lead to a story like "As a data engineer, I want webhooks to trigger job reruns so that I can automate issue resolution." This enhances operational efficiency, a critical aspect for enterprise applications.

Summary of Features and Challenges Addressed
The generated user stories collectively address key data observability challenges:

Monitoring and Alerting: Ensuring teams are the first to know about data issues, reducing downtime and improving trust in data.
Integrations: Enabling seamless connectivity with modern data stacks, enhancing usability for data teams.
Governance and Security: Providing access control and auditing, crucial for enterprise compliance and security.
This approach ensures your application can match or exceed Metaplane's capabilities, leveraging the insights from the discussion.

Comparative Analysis with External Sources
External searches confirmed Metaplane's features, such as anomaly detection and lineage analysis, aligning with the notes. For example, Metaplane Platform Overview lists monitoring and usage analytics, reinforcing the notes' accuracy. Similarly, data observability definitions from Monte Carlo Data emphasize freshness and lineage, supporting the prompt's focus on these areas.
